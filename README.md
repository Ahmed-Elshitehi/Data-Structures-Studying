# Data-Structures-Studying

I will do my best to make this a good reference for Anybody to study Data Structures I will split it into several steps. <br>
And there is the total number of problems while I'm studying this core ( 0 )  I'm sure you can do better than me.<br>
## - [**Step zero**](https://github.com/Ahmed-Elshitehi/Data-Structures-Studying/edit/main/README.md#step-zero)

## Step zero 
### First of all I have two questions **what is Date Structure ?** And **Why do I want to study Data Structure?**<br>
#### ***What is Date Structure ?*** 
>  A data structure is a way of organizing data in the computer memory that we can use effectively.
#### ***Why do I want to study Data Structure?*** 

> You know that we store data in the memory and reuse it so we need fast and powerful algorithms to do that.<br>
> Now you may have a  question how can we compare between algorithms to know the most  useful algorithm in my case <br>
> I may have an algorithm that is so fast but take a lot of memory or in other case, you may have an algorithm so slow but take little memory or another one so fast and take little memory<br>
>  > Wait a second How can I compare between algorithms <br>
>  >  So to compare between Algorithms One of the most fundamental ways to compare algorithms is to analyze their **Time And Space complexity**.<br><br>
>  > And this is some resources to know about **Time And Space complexity** <br>

>  >  > Search and you will find more and more <br>

>  >  We will learn about the Implementation of the basic data structures. <br>
>  >  Now you may have another question Why should I know something like that in case I can use the built-in data structure like STL in C++?<br>
>  >  I will ask you a question what is better using these black boxes or knowing the implementation of them and having the ability to build your own data structure?<br>

### Do you know any data structure?
> The answer is **YES** you know the **array**
#### Array Data Structure
>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding >an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
